#  PyTorch for Deep Learning: Convolutional Neural Nets - Testing with Fashion-MNIST

This time we will be coding a CNN (like LeNet) but this time for greyscale
images of clothing (hence FASHION MNIST).
Very similar to the previous LeNet code, see if you can spot the differences!
(Other than the obvious creating a plot and such).

Fashion MNIST Training dataset -> 60,000 images
Fashion MNIST Testing dataset -> 10,000 images
